Hi, I'm Michael. I have just finished my master's in Artificial Intelligence. In this time, I have really enjoyed learning to code and have developed a keen interest in using and improving Transformer-based models to solve a variety of complex NLP tasks. Right now, I am catching up on the exceptional growth that has taken place in generative AI since the release of ChatGPT last year and am excited to learn more about how these models can be used to accelerate business processes.
